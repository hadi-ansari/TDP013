## How to get started with the project (Linux ubuntu)
After cloning repository follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed **mongo** and **nodejs** in your system. You can check it by typing **_"mongo -version"_** and **_"node -v"_** in your command line. It is recommended to have at least **nodejs** version 14 or higher.
1. In order to restore the database files, type **_"mongorestore --db = [database name] [database directory path]"_**. You can find the database directory in _"/lab2/database"_ directory.
1. After opening the lab3, type **_"npm install jquery"_** to install the **jQuery** for the program, thereafter type **_"npm audit fix"_** to fix the installed modules. 
1. Navigate to the back-end directory "cd **_lab2/my-app"_**.
1. Now you can start the server (port 3000) by typing **_"npm start"_** in the terminal.
1. Navigate back to the lab3 directory and open **_"main.html"_** file in your browser to see the result.
1. **Enjoy!**
